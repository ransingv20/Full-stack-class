    <h1>NSO projections of GDP seem overly optimistic even as the economy rebounds</h1>
    <p>The first advanced estimates of economic output for the current financial year posit a picture of an economy
    rebounding robustly in the second half from the pandemic-induced slump of the preceding two quarters. The National
    Statistical Office on Thursday projected that GDP in the 12 months ending March would total almost ₹134.4-lakh crore
    in constant prices, reflecting a 7.7% contraction from the preceding year’s figure. To reach that level, the NSO has
    assumed that output will recover vigorously in the third and fourth quarters. After contracting by almost 16% in the
    April-September period, it sees GDP being just a mere ₹10,400 crore short of the year-earlier second half’s figure.
    It is this mathematical projection that is hard to square with the economic reality revealed in both the NSO’s more
    detailed sectoral output forecasts as well as other emerging trends from ground-level activity. Both the expenditure
    side and gross value added (GVA) across various industries point to the high degree of optimism implicit in the
    NSO’s assumptions. Private consumption expenditure — the single biggest component propelling GDP, at well over 50% —
    is estimated to shrink 9.5% in the full year, after contracting nearly 19% in the first half. This presupposes that
    consumers have largely shed their wariness to spend in the face of COVID-19 and have begun to set about consuming
    goods and services at close to pre-<mark>pandemic levels, the dampening impact of lost jobs and reduced incomes
    not with standing.</mark> GVA data for manufacturing and services, however, seem to belie this postulation.
</p>
<p>
    While the NSO expects manufacturing to shrink 9.4% this fiscal, albeit narrowing from an almost 20% contraction in
    the first half, it sees the crucial GVA services component of trade, hotels, transport, communication and
    broadcasting contracting 21.4% (the most among all the GVA constituents) over the 12-month period. Clearly, with the
    mandated social distancing norms having taken the highest toll on high-risk indoor activities, it is this omnibus
    services sector which contributes almost a fifth to overall GVA that is bearing the brunt of the pandemic-related
    restrictions. The forecast for government spending also appears far too upbeat. The NSO sees government final
    consumption expenditure (GFCE) jumping 17% in the second half, erasing the first-half’s contraction and buoying the
    annual figure to a growth of 5.8%. The end-November fiscal deficit data show the government lagging well behind its
    budgeted revenue and capital expenditure targets, and with just four months to go and revenue receipts continuing to
    underwhelm, it is hard to fathom how the GFCE can increase so appreciably in the second half. True, the NSO has
    furnished a caveat that its estimates are likely to undergo sharp revisions. The upcoming Economic Survey could move
    away from these overly optimistic assumptions with a more sober assessment of the economy.
